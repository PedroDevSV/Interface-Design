Mark Knopfler’s first big guitar-hero moment — the fleet, gloriously melodic solo on Dire Straits’ 1978 hit “Sultans of Swing” — came at a time when punk seemed to be rendering the idea of a guitar hero obsolete. And yet Knopfler built a reputation as an intensely creative virtuoso (not to mention an ace songwriter), showing remarkable command over a range of tones and textures — from the gnarly distortion on hit single “Money for Nothing” to the stinging precision of “Tunnel of Love.” One key to Knopfler’s signature style: playing without a pick. “Playing with your fingers,” he has said, “has something to do with immediacy and soul.” Knopfler’s versatility made him much in demand for projects with artists including Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, and Bob Dylan, who first called on Knopfler for 1979’s Slow Train Coming. —A.L.

Key Tracks: “Sultans of Swing,” “Romeo and Juliet”

Not surprising for someone who grew up adoring both Kiss and the Melvins, Kurt Cobain’s approach to his instrument lay in that fertile ground between arena rock and indie punk. “I never wanted to sing,” Cobain told Rolling Stone in 1994, recalling his pre-success days. “I just wanted to play rhythm guitar — hide in the back and just play.” Cobain knew his way around a potent power chord (“In Bloom” and “Stay Away”), but his solos were always inventive and unconventional, from the serrated-edge grind in “School” (on Nirvana’s debut, Bleach) to the fire-alarm buzz in his last recording, Nirvana’s “You Know You’re Right.” Cobain favored texture and rawness over flash, and from him, a generation of alt rockers learned you didn’t have to be a virtuoso to be a guitar hero. —D.B.

Key Tracks: “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” “Scentless Apprentice”

If “Eruption” were all Eddie Van Halen ever released, he would have still secured a spot in the guitar pantheon. With finger-tapped, piano-like cascades of sound, gut-checking dive bombs, and trumpet-like reveilles, he showed the world that the guitar was capable of more than anyone had ever dreamed of on that solo. But Van Halen’s true magic was how he could take these showstopping tricks and transform them into songs that people would enjoy singing along to: “Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love,” “Dance the Night Away,” “Everybody Wants Some!!,” “Jump” — tunes that combined Van Halen’s formidable techniques in tuneful ways alongside David Lee Roth’s gonzo lyrics.

Beyond the party anthems, guitar solos like “Spanish Fly,” “Cathedral,” and “Little Guitars” felt more like compositions than solos, and he never stopped experimenting; he recorded an electric drill next to his pickup on “Poundcake” to make his instrument scream. “With Eddie Van Halen, everyone was riveted,” Tom Morello said after his death. “Because everyone knew we were in the presence of our generation’s Mozart.” And even when Van Halen wasn’t playing, he was applying his genius to his instrument, building his “Frankenstrat,” inventing a floating whammy bar, and securing various patents, completely changing the way people thought about guitar. Oh, and he was self-taught. —K.G.

Long before the formation of Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page had already made a tremendous impact in the world of rock due to his playing in the Yardbirds and his work as a session guitarist all across the London scene. When he was just in his early twenties, Page was the first-called guitarist to play on records by the Who, the Kinks, Donovan, Marianne Faithfull, and others. But in 1968, he solidified his role as one of the all-time rock guitar gods when he formed a band with singer Robert Plant, bassist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham.

With Led Zeppelin, everything about Page became instantly legendary — from his embroidered dragon suit to his obsession with the occult — but his blazing riffs were always at the forefront. You can’t hear “Communication Breakdown” or “In the Evening” and not have it in your head for 72 hours. “A riff ought to be quite hypnotic, because it will be played over and over again,” he told Rolling Stone in 2012. And his playing also has its delicate moments, like the stunning fingerpicking on “Going to California” or the intro to “Stairway to Heaven.” “He had this vision to transcend the stereotypes of what the guitar can do,” Aerosmith’s Joe Perry said. “If you follow the guitar on ‘The Song Remains the Same’ all the way through, it evolves through so many different changes — louder, quieter, softer, louder again. He was writing the songs, playing them, producing them — I can’t think of any other guitar player since Les Paul that can claim that.” —A.M

Jimi Hendrix lighting his Fender Stratocaster on fire at Monterey Pop is one of the most iconic images in rock history. He was a showman who played with his teeth or behind his back. But underneath all the theatrics is the true master of the instrument. His career may have lasted eight years, but musicians spend a lifetime studying his dazzling technique and improvisational genius. Hendrix sang, but he chose to make his guitar the leading voice. He popularized the use of feedback, invented his own fusion of blues and psychedelia, and influenced the development of rock, metal, funk, and much more. Hendrix was eloquent not only in his playing, but the way he spoke about playing. “The wah-wah pedal is great because it doesn’t have any notes,” he told Rolling Stone in 1968. “Nothing but hitting it straight up using the vibrato and then the drums come through and that there feels like … not depression, but that loneliness and that frustration and the yearning for something. Like something is reaching out.”

The “Ambassador of the Blues” was such a beloved figure in American music, it’s easy to forget how revolutionary his guitar work was. As Buddy Guy said, “Before B.B., everyone played the guitar like it was an acoustic.” King made his famous Gibson “Lucille” weep like a real woman. From the opening notes of his 1951 breakthrough hit, “Three O’Clock Blues,” you can hear his innovative, fluid style. King’s string-bending and vibrato came from his idol T-Bone Walker, but he took it all somewhere new, changing how everyone else played. “Every electric guitarist you listen to, there’s a little bit of B.B. in there,” Guy said. “He was the father of squeezing the string on the electric guitar.”

--eric Clapton
Since starting his career on the British blues-rock scene during the 1960s, Clapton had a unique gift for melody that made his solos just as catchy as the songs they adorned. He was always a diligent student of the blues, from Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters to Albert King and Otis Rush, and even cut an album of (mostly) pre-electric repertoire with Wynton Marsalis. But his most memorable recordings were born of real-life tragedy, from “Layla,” inspired by stealing the wife (Patti Boyd) of his best friend (George Harrison); to “Tears in Heaven,” a lament for the infant son who fell to his death from an apartment window. These days, nobody really considers Clapton god (his COVID comments clearly rule out any chance of being all-knowing), but that doesn’t stop guitarists from worshipping his playing. —J.D.C.

--prince
He played arguably the greatest power-ballad guitar solo in history (“Purple Rain”). He can funk it up like Jimmy Nolen and Nile Rodgers, or scream like Eddie Van Halen. Like Bo Diddley, he reimagined the shape of the guitar itself — first his yellow “cloud guitar” from the mid-Eighties, and later his crazily-phallic “symbol guitar,” sculpted like the icon he briefly adopted as his name. And while he got a lot of Jimi Hendrix comparisons, Prince saw things differently: “It’s only because he’s Black. That’s really the only thing we have in common,” he once told Rolling Stone. “If they really listened to my stuff, they’d hear more of a Santana influence than Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix played more blues, Santana played prettier.” He also has identified one little-known benefit to being a guitar god. “Playing electric guitar your whole life does something to you,” he says. “I’m convinced all that electricity racing through my body made me keep my hair.” —W.H.

--santana
Carlos Santana’s pioneering fusion of blues, jazz, and Latin music was introduced to the world with a show-stopping performance at Woodstock. It was just as powerful 30 years later, when Supernatural sold 15 million copies and won nine Grammys. For all that time, Santana simply remained his ultracool self, conjuring glorious melodies with one foot in the barrio and the other in some distant astral plane. “His music was something new, but it was intertwined with everything else that was out there at the time,” said Henry Garza of Los Lonely Boys. “He incorporated his culture into the music.” Like Miles Davis, B.B. King, and very few other musicians, Santana is the rare instrumentalist who can be identified in just one note. He says that he attempted to imitate his own heroes, especially jazzmen like Wes Montgomery and Grant Green, but “as hard as I tried, I couldn’t — I always sounded like me.” In turn, no one can replicate Santana’s exquisite, crystalline guitar tone, but his impact has truly been global. Prince, for one, has claimed him as a bigger influence than Jimi Hendrix, explaining simply that “Santana played prettier.”

--angus 
“Thunderstruck,” AC/DC’s 1990 single, sounds like the middle of a Venn diagram with Mozart on one side and John Lee Hooker on the other. Angus Young plays the lightning-flickering classical ostinato, while his brother, Malcolm, commands foundation-shaking blues riffs that provide a solid surface for AC/DC’s inimitable combustion. The pairing of Angus’ rowdiness and Malcolm’s blue-collar reliability propelled the band to fame just as much as singers Bon Scott and Brian Johnson’s randy double-entendres. For every shit-kicking “Highway to Hell” or “Back in Black” riff that Malcolm held down, Angus, a five-foot-two problem child who dressed like a schoolboy and mooned the audience, would play the type of high-voltage solos that made him an instant guitar hero. And when they pair their powers, like on “Whole Lotta Rosie,” “If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It),” and “For Those About to Rock,” it creates a current totally their own. —K.G
